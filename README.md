# Role Based Access Control System UI
Currently, it is only the UI part of the **RBAC** system. In this, I have used a scenario where there are several **employees**, **managers**, and only one **admin** of a corporate office.
The project is the admin dashboard UI which has the following features.
- **View Edit Delete Add** all the users details
- **View Edit Delete Add** some project details
- **Manage role-based** resource control for all the users
- **Set permissions and roles** for all the users

## Project Description
- Any **dashboard** is better in **large** screen hence not applicable for smaller screens
- All the data used or shown is **static**
- **No database** is linked currently
- While interacting with the website **no changes** will be made as the **backend** is not connected
- **No Authentication** for now will be added later
- You will see a **Go to Dashboard** button which will take you to the dashboard

## Library used
- **React** for frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn UI** for elements
- **Typescript** as language

## Steps for setting up locally on your device
- Clone the repository on your device

      cd client

      npm run dev
